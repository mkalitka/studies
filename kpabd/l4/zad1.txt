ACID is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably.

A - Atomicity: A transaction is a single unit of work.
Either the entire transaction is processed or none of it is.

C - Consistency: The database is in a consistent state before and after the transaction,
ensuring that all rules and constraints are maintained.

I - Isolation: Transactions are independent of each other,
and concurrent transactions are executed as if they were run sequentially.

D - Durability: Once a transaction is committed, it will remain in the system,
even in the event of a system failure.
